            <h3>A guide on Palermo</h3>
            <p>– a jewel city – can be described as the most beautiful example of unity between art, craft and religion from Western Europe, Byzantine and Arabic culture and a testimony of harmonious living between people of all religious background, etymologies and cultures. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, this city has been at the heart of the ancient trading routes and a place where religion and trade flourished. Often described as “the most conquered city” Palermo has been ruled by Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Germans and finally the Sicilian Mafia.</p>

                  <h3>The City</h3>
                  <p>Palermo is the Capital of Sicily, which is the largest Italian Island at the tip of the boot shaped peninsula. Located on the north side of the island, the port city benefits both from tall mountains and seaside. Useful things to note are:
                  <ul id="code">
                     <li>International Dialing Code: +39</li>
                     <li>Average High Temperature : 28.8°C</li>
                     <li>Average Low Temperature : 8.2°C</li>
                     <li>Currency: Euro(EUR)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                     The relatively mild climate allows Palermo to be visited all year around, although the best time is in the summer when the sea is warm and can be great refreshment from the warmth.

                     <p>I was very impressed by the Norman Chapel with the golden mosaics and the city’s rich history. We had a lot of yummy food. My favourite so far was the aubergine melanzata – a sort of oven baked pastry. I really recommend it. We didn’t manage to get to the catacombs, but a great reason to visit again soon. </p>

                     <!--Palermo was originally founded by Phoenician tradesmen around the 8th century BC because of the natural port conditions of the landscape. The Greek called the city Panormus- meaning all-port. 
                        The city remained Phoenician until the First Punic war (264-241BC) when Sicily fell under the Roman rule. Under the Roman Rule, the city experienced a moment of relative calm. 
                        When the Roman Empire split, Sicily came under the rule of the Eastern Byzantine Empire. <br><br>
                        This lasted until the 9th century when the Arab forces took the city in 831. During the Arab rule, The capital of Sicily was moved to Palermo and the city became a hub of trade, culture and learning.  It is said that more than 300 mosques were built in the city. In this period of peace, Muslim, Jews and Christians lived together in tolerance and prospered. 
                        In 1060 a crusade wad launched and Palermo and Sicily fell under Norman rule. The Normans allowed for the tolerance to continue, but converted a lot of the mosques into churches under their rule. This hybrid style between Norman and Arab culture can be best seen in the Palatine Chapel inside the Norman Palace. 
                        In 1194, Palermo once again fell under the control of the Holy Roman Empire, followed by the Angevin rule (1266-1282), and followed by the house of Aragon and later in 1479 the Kingdom of Spain. In the 15th century the population of Palermo grew but was also reduced by the plague. 
                        In the 15th and 16th century, Baroque basilicas were built in Palermo, many which can be seen today. <br><br>
                        Sicily’s unification in 1734 with the Bourbon Rules kingdom of Neaples striped Palermo of its importance and in this period, many palaces fell into decay.-->

                     <br>
                     <br> Palermo continued to fall under the control of different administration systems, such as The Holy Roman Empire(1194), Angevin rule(1266-1282), House of Aragon, Kingdom of Spain(1479), Bourbon Rule (1734) and finally annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1860.

                     <br> In the 15th and 16th century, Baroque basilicas were built in Palermo, many which can be seen today. Under the Bourbon rule, Palermo lost its importance and many buildings and palaces fell into decay.
                     <br>
                     <br> In 1848 the first revolutionary upheavals started in Palermo. The Italian Risorgimento and Sicily's annexation (1860) to the kingdom of Italy gave Palermo a chance to once again become the administrative center of Sicily and prosper. This was mainly led by the Florio Family.
                     <br>
                     <br> In the early 20th century, Palermo expanded outside the old city walls with new buildings in Art Nouveau Style and many villas built by the famous architect Ernesto Basile.

                     <h3> The Sicilian Mafia</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>
                     The origins of the Sicilian Mafia can be traced to the beginning of the 19th century (around 1812) and enhanced with the later annexation to the mainland Italy of 1860.
                     <br>
                     <br> Due to the political situation in Sicily, the local authorities did not have enough forces to reduce crime on the island. For this reason, traders which usually dealt with citrus growing or cattle ranching hired their own personal protection to ensure their crop prospered. This protection contained a mix of former criminals and young strong men-at-arms - the original mafia - and in time would become an organisation that would sell their services and use their previous criminal ocupations to recover and negociate stolen goods. The police at the time writes that the success rate of recoving a stolen cow was 95% for the hired protectors while for the police it was only 10%.
                     <br>
                     <br> The popularity of this group encouraged them to use their power to win political votes and protection from the authorities. They could also control the growth and success of certain businesses and force locals into submission.
                     <br>
                     <br> During the fascist rule in 1925, Benito Mussolini appointed Piana dei Greci to remove the mafia in Sicily and restore power to the authorities. This campaign was successful and a lot of business owners were freed from the previous restrictions and could increase their prices to the national average. However the mafia was not completely removed. In this time a lot of mafia fled abroad, setting up new clans in the US and France and got involved in heroin distribution and cigarette smuggling between Italy and the US.
                     <br>
                     <br> To this day, there are still a lot of efforts to try to capture Mafia bosses and halt their organised crime operations.
